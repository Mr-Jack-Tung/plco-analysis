This Snakemake workflow will run the plco LDSC workflow and generate report for each of the summary statstics files

The config_template.yaml file is provided.  
$cp  config_template.yaml config.yaml
and make changes to the config.yaml file. The workflow expects the config file config.yaml.

The file with the list of GWAS summary files is also required. See config_template.yaml for more information.

To run the pipeline locally (with snakemake installed, preferably as a conda environment):
$snakemake --use-conda  -s Snakefile -j1
